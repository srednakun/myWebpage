						<div class="aboutMe"><h2>About Me</h2>
						<p> I am always up for a new foodie adventure! I've been to a french resturant in Seattle, where I tried escargot and foi gras for the first time! They were both delicious, but the foi gras was like a taste of heaven to me. I'm hooked for life now! That pic of me with the ferris wheel in the background was taken at that resturant, Maximilian.</p>
						<p>Nature is facinating to me and I love going outside to explore it. I go hiking ocassionally and the pic was taken at Cougar Mountain Park in Issawuah.</p>
						<p>Art is one of my greatest loves. And my art reflects all the facets that make up who I am. At times I'll be carving a scary Halloween pumpkin, or painting a complex emotional piece, and other times painting beatiful, colorful, and bright flowers. When I'm working on a piece of art it feels so freeing to me. The pic with the flower painting was drawn by me!</p>
						<p>I'm always up for a performative dance show too! The picture with Aaron and I was taken at the Pacific Northwest Ballet in Seattle. That night, around Christmas time, we saw the ever so classic Nutcracker. After the show we even got to take some pics with a character from the play!</p>
						<h2>Where I'm From</h2>
						<p>I grew up mostly in Maryland, where crab love roams free. Here, a much beloved seasoning called Old Bay, is the go to equivalent of salt &amp; pepper. And eating crabs, is as much an experience, as it is tasty. The preference, is to get a large group of friends/family together in your backyard, break out the long picnic table, and go to town, on tons of small blue crabs. You can buy them by the box/bushel at local seafood resturants, along with mallets and such. Then, when the delcious pre-seasoned old bay crabs arrive, they are dumped out along the table, and for the next hour or so, you hear lots of crunching/cracking and finger lickin' good lip smacks.</p>
							<p>	Besides the blue crabs, there's the chesapeake bay in downtown Baltimore. There's also shops, resturants, and pirate ships along the pier. I've had many good memories there, including skipping school with my best friends.</p>
							<p>Now, I live in Renton (just outside of Seattle) and am enjoying the other side of coastal living. There's plenty of greenery here, which makes me happy. The weather is nice and instead of a winter, it's rainy season. I do miss getting a couple feet of snow, and the snow days. When there are snow days, that means schools out!</p>
							<p>Lets see, maybe I should tell you that in between Maryland and Seattle, there was a move, to the blizzard state capitol, Minnesota. I moved up there after high school, looking for a new adventure. I wanted to go someplace I hadn't visited before, and where I could make a new start for myself, all on my own. Considering winter used to be my favorite time of year (before moving to minnesota), I thought, "Why not! I love winter and as long as they have a winter season, that's fine". What I didn't know, is that winter in Minnesota and winter everywhere else in the galaxy, are two completely different things. In Minnesota, winters are at least 6 months out of the year. And consist of freezing, negative temperature, and shivering to the bone cold weather. A lot of the times you can't really be outside much, cause you would get frostbite pretty easily. Its more of a, run inside the warm building, kinda thing, rather than a, lets play outside making snow angels for hours, kinda thing.</p>
							<p>Once winter ends, somewhere around march/april, then comes flood season. Its called that because all the snow has melted, and it actually creates a really big problem. The amount of snow that accumulates from around oct-march, is now metling and there's not much place for that amount of water to go. This creates a flooding effect. Now for farmers, and this great state is a big farming state, this kinda weather is great for that. The crop beds get really well saturated with moisture and it makes for an ideal place for farming. For the rest of us, it only means trouble.</p>
							<p>I lived in the Fargo/Moorhead region, which has a river that becomes troublesome aroung spring. Which now leads into, the ever so popluar "Sand Bagging" method. Sand bagging is a way to combat the rise of the river. Sand bags are placed along the sides of the river bank and then stacked and stacked until they're high enough, to keep the rising tide from overflowing. College students are a highly sought after recruit force for sandbagging, that's how I heard about it. I haven't particiated in it, but it seems like it would be a good community bonding experience and helpful as well.</p>
							<p>In the midst of the blizzards and sandbagging, I found time to go to a wonderful university called MSUM (Minnesota State University Moorhead). There, I majored in Computer Science &amp; East Asian Language Studies. Later, I switched to focusing soly on Computer Science. I had a blast at that school for 2 years and learned so much from my collegeues and teachers. That's where I met my partner Aaron too, so I have a lot of nice memories there. I also met a lot of friendly people out there, a term well known as "Minnesota Nice". Okay, well known to that area and some states around there too. Seriously though, the nicest people I have ever met are Minnesoteans. They are what make Minnesota a great place to live.</p>
							<p>Fast forward to now and the move to Seattle! This little place called Amazon.com wanted Aaron to work for them, so yes we said, and yes we moved. The rest is history!</p>

						<!--<p>Seattle has turned out to be a pretty techy kinda city, filled with food conscious folk (local,organic,farm-to-table concepts) and genuine care for the environment we live in. I think its rubbed off a bit on me.</p>-->
						<!--<p>Nowadays I'm taking a break from work to go to school at Code Fellows. It's a coding school that prepares you for a development career, in a short amount of time. I had origninally planned on finishing up my degree at a university, but that wouldn't work for me right now. Code Fellows ended up being the answer, for exactly what I need, at this point in my life. Their program works, by getting you prepared for their Development Accelorator. The accelorator is an intense, 8 week 9-5 study in the programming field of your choice. For me, that means Front-End Web Development. Since I came into it knowing quite a bit already, I jumped right into their GitHub one day class followed by Foundations II Javascript. I finished the GitHub class one saturaday and then in the month of July am completing their FoundationsII class. So far so good! You have to get at 85% to pass the class, so I just make sure I do things as correctly as possible to get top marks on everything. Its a nightly class and its 2 days a week.</p>
						<p>Before that class started though, I had just applied for the code fellows development accelorator. Which is typically done I think, after the FoundationsII class is completed. But considering in 1.5 weeks I taught myself javascript,html,css, and a little bit of jquery, I had enough knowledge to complete the coding challenege they assigned me.</p>
						<p>The coding challenge is what they gave me after a phone interview, where someone asked about why I'm interested in doing this, and my experience. About 10 days after they gave me the assignment I completed the 3 challenges, submitted it, and they actually responded to me that day. Telling me, I had moved on and now I had a 10min in person interview. The interview turned out to be around 30-40min and a lot more intense than I had anticipated. It turns out I had one thing still left to do, which is to create a personal website.</p></div>-->
