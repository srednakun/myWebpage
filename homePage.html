			<!--Who by the way their lead singer Chris Cornell is performing an intimate concert in seattle in september. I couldn't get tickets this time around but I will someday! The band got their start in seattle so its no wonder other grunge rock lovin folks bought their tickets right away. I was 3 min into the opening window to buy tickets and already number 280-something on the waitlist! Crazy fans -->
