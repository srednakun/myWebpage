				<p>I follow up with the latests happenings in the tech world, espically when it comes to computerizing your home.</p>
				<p>I give you the Amazon Echo! Its a device made by Amazon Inc, that you can talk to, and it does what you want. When talking to this device, the activation word default is "Alexa". This means, when talking to the echo, start off with the word "Alexa", followed by a request.</p>
				<p>Here is a description of the Amazon Echo from good ol' Wikipedia:</p>
				<p>"Amazon Echo is a voice command device from Amazon.com with functions including question answering, playing music and controlling smart devices. The device consists of a 9.25-inch (23.5 cm) tall cylinder speaker with a seven-piece microphone array, speakers that include a woofer/tweeter and a remote control"</p>
				<p>What does this mean for everyday users?<p>
					<ul>
						<li>I can tell it to play my music.</li>
						<li>I can tell it what to add to my shopping list.</li>
						<li>I ask it questions like "whats the weather?" and "whats traffic like for my commute?"</li>
						<li>If I'm in a humorous mood, I say "Alexa tell me a joke", and she tells me a funny joke.<li>
					</ul>
					<p>To give you a better understanding of what "Alexa" is capeable of, I'm going to give some examples of things I've said to Alexa, and her responses. Note: Most of my music is on Aaron's music account, so if she is going to play music, she'll say its from Aaron's music library.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><p>Me: "Alexa play playlist, Sredna's classical music"</p>
							<p>Alexa: "Sredna's classical music from Aaron's music library" - she then proceeds to play that playlist.</p></li>
						<li><p>Me: "Alexa add Milk to my shopping list"</p>
							<p>Alexa: "I've put milk on your shopping list"-milk has been added to my shopping list that I can see on my amazon echo phone app.</p></li>
						<li><p>Me: "Alexa, whats the weather like?"</p>
							<p>Alexa: "Right now in Renton its 91 degrees with clear skies and sun, tonight's forecast has clear skies and a low of 64."
						<li><p>Me: "Alexa tell me a joke"</p>
							<p>Alexa: "How many therapists does it take to change a light bulb? One, but it has to really want to change."</p></li>
						<li><p>Me: "Alex do you love me?"</p>
						    <p>Alexa: "I can't do that, but I can find Lionel Richie songs if you like."</p></li>
						<li><p>Me: "Alexa, don't let the bed bugs bight"</p>
						    <p>Alexa: "Thankfully I don't sleep in a bed."</p></li>
					</ul>	    
						<p> As you can see she can do practical things that are helpful to your everyday life, and also say random funny things that put a smile on your face.</p>
